        <h2>Normal User Price</h2>
        <p>
          If the basic price for a "normal user" is base plan at 999 rupees for the virtual product you are referring to, it indicates that this is the standard price set for individual customers without any specific variations. However, it's important to note that the factors I mentioned earlier, such as features and functionality, licensing or subscription models, market demand, and competition, can still play a role in the pricing strategy for virtual products.

        While the basic price may be fixed, there could be different pricing tiers or additional features available at higher prices. For example, there might be premium versions or subscription plans with extra functionalities or extended support that are priced higher than the basic package.
        
        Market demand and competition can also influence the pricing of virtual products. If there is high demand or intense competition in the market, the pricing strategy may be adjusted accordingly. This could involve offering discounts, promotions, or even adjusting the price upward if the product becomes more valuable or in-demand.
