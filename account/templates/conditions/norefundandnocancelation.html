      <h5>Customer satisfaction:</h5>
      <p>A strict no cancellation and no refund policy may deter potential customers from making a purchase, as they may perceive a higher risk associated with buying your product without any recourse if they are unhappy with it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4">
      <h5>Reputation:</h5>
      <p>A rigid policy could lead to negative reviews and word-of-mouth, which can harm your business's reputation. Customer feedback is vital, and if customers feel they have no way to address their concerns, it can lead to public dissatisfaction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4">
      <h5>Legal considerations:</h5>
      <p>Consumer protection laws vary by country and region, and some jurisdictions may require businesses to provide refunds or cancellations under specific circumstances. It's essential to review the laws in your area to ensure your policy aligns with legal requirements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-4">

    <div class="mt-4">
